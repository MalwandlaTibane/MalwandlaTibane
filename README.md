### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, and I’m revamping my GitHub profile to **stand out in the job market** and track my growth as a developer.

💡 Why I started with Software Engineering:  
> _As an educator and hands-on learner, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work. From fixing cars to exploring systems, my curiosity has driven me to learn how to build with code and solve real-world problems._

🎯 **My Vision:**  
To grow into a resourceful and values-driven engineer who contributes to innovative, human-centered tech solutions in Africa and beyond.
